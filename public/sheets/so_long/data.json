            "- Carefully verify that no malicious aliases are used to deceive the evaluator into grading non-official content.",
            "- If applicable, review any **scripts** used for testing or automation together with the student.",
            "- If you haven’t completed the assignment you’re evaluating, read the entire subject before starting the evaluation.",
            "- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning program, a **Norm** error, or cheating. The evaluation process ends with a final grade of 0 (or -42 for cheating). However, except in cases of cheating, students are encouraged to review the work together to identify mistakes to avoid in the future.",
            "- Remember that no **segfaults** or other unexpected program terminations will be tolerated during the evaluation. If this occurs, the final grade is 0. Use the appropriate flag.",
            "- You should not need to edit any files except the configuration file, if it exists. If editing a file is necessary, explain the reasons to the evaluated student and ensure mutual agreement.",
            "- Verify the absence of **memory leaks.** All memory allocated on the heap must be properly freed before the program ends.",
            "- You may use tools like leaks, **valgrind,** or **e_fence** to check for memory leaks. If memory leaks are found, tick the appropriate flag."
